## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

*In a few sentences, describe your final project.*

### 2. Motivation

*What is the problem that you are trying to solve? Why is this project interesting? What is the intended purpose?*

### 3. System Block Diagram

*Show your high level design, as done in WS1 and WS2. What are the critical components in your system? How do they communicate (I2C?, interrupts, ADC, etc.)? What power regulation do you need?*

### 4. Design Sketches

*What will your project look like? Do you have any critical design features? Will you need any special manufacturing techniques to achieve your vision, like power tools, laser cutting, or 3D printing?*

### 5. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

*Formulate key software requirements here. Think deeply on the design: What must your device do? How will you measure this during validation testing? Create 4 to 8 critical system requirements.*

*These must be testable! See the Final Project Manual Appendix for details. Refer to the table below; replace these examples with your own.*

**5.1 Definitions, Abbreviations**

Here, you will define any special terms, acronyms, or abbreviations you plan to use for hardware

**5.2 Functionality**

| ID     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SRS-01 | The IMU 3-axis acceleration will be measured with 16-bit depth every 100 milliseconds +/-10 milliseconds                                                                                                                 |
| SRS-02 | The distance sensor shall operate and report values at least every .5 seconds.                                                                                                                                           |
| SRS-03 | Upon non-nominal distance detected (i.e., the trap mechanism has changed at least 10 cm from the nominal range), the system shall be able to detect the change and alert the user in a timely manner (within 5 seconds). |
| SRS-04 | Upon a request from the user, the system shall get an image from the internal camera and upload the image to the user system within 10s.                                                                                 |

### 6. Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS)

*Formulate key hardware requirements here. Think deeply on the design: What must your device do? How will you measure this during validation testing? Create 4 to 8 critical system requirements.*

*These must be testable! See the Final Project Manual Appendix for details. Refer to the table below; replace these examples with your own.*

**6.1 Definitions, Abbreviations**

Here, you will define any special terms, acronyms, or abbreviations you plan to use for hardware

**6.2 Functionality**

| ID     | Description                                                                                                                        |

| HRS-02 | A noisemaker shall be inside the trap with a strength of at least 55 dB.                                                           |
| HRS-03 | An electronic motor shall be used to reset the trap remotely and have a torque of 40 Nm in order to reset the trap mechanism.      |
| HRS-04 | A camera sensor shall be used to capture images of the trap interior. The resolution shall be at least 480p.                       |

### 7. Bill of Materials (BOM)

*What major components do you need and why? Try to be as specific as possible. Your Hardware & Software Requirements Specifications should inform your component choices.*

*In addition to this written response, copy the Final Project BOM Google Sheet and fill it out with your critical components (think: processors, sensors, actuators). Include the link to your BOM in this section.*

### 8. Final Demo Goals

*How will you demonstrate your device on demo day? Will it be strapped to a person, mounted on a bicycle, require outdoor space? Think of any physical, temporal, and other constraints that could affect your planning.*

### 9. Sprint Planning

*You've got limited time to get this project done! How will you plan your sprint milestones? How will you distribute the work within your team? Review the schedule in the final project manual for exact dates.*

| Milestone  | Functionality Achieved | Distribution of Work |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Sprint #1  |                        |                      |
| Sprint #2  |                        |                      |
| MVP Demo   |                        |                      |
| Final Demo |                        |                      |

## Final Project Report

Don't forget to make the GitHub pages public website!
If you’ve never made a GitHub pages website before, you can follow this webpage (though, substitute your final project repository for the GitHub username one in the quickstart guide):  [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)

### 1. Video

[Insert final project video here]

* The video must demonstrate your key functionality.
* The video must be 5 minutes or less.
* Ensure your video link is accessible to the teaching team. Unlisted YouTube videos or Google Drive uploads with SEAS account access work well.
* Points will be removed if the audio quality is poor - say, if you filmed your video in a noisy electrical engineering lab.

### 2. Images

[Insert final project images here]

*Include photos of your device from a few angles. If you have a casework, show both the exterior and interior (where the good EE bits are!).*

### 3. Results

*What were your results? Namely, what was the final solution/design to your problem?*

#### 3.1 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Results

*Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected requirements.*

*Did your requirements change? If so, why? Failing to meet a requirement is acceptable; understanding the reason why is critical!*

*Validate at least two requirements, showing how you tested and your proof of work (videos, images, logic analyzer/oscilloscope captures, etc.).*
